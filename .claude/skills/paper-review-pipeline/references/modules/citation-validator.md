# Module: Citation Validator (Claim-Level Audit) -- Feature-Parity Import

This module preserves the "citation audit" workflow and report format from the legacy `citation-validator` skill.

## Core Responsibilities (Must Support)

1) Verify citation presence for every factual claim.
2) Validate citation completeness (required metadata).
3) Assess source quality (A-E).
4) Check citation accuracy (source supports claim).
5) Detect hallucinations (unsupported claims / non-existent sources).
6) Enforce consistent formatting.

## Citation Completeness Requirements (Must Support)

Each citation should include (as applicable):
- Author/Organization
- Publication date (at least year)
- Source title
- URL/DOI (verifiable)
- Page numbers (for PDFs/long docs when relevant)

## Source Quality Rating (Must Support)

- A: peer-reviewed meta-analyses, strong journals, government regulators
- B: solid studies/guidelines, reputable analysts, government sites
- C: case reports, company whitepapers, reputable news
- D: preprints, blogs without oversight
- E: anonymous/broken links/clear bias

## Validation Process (Must Support)

1) Claim detection: enumerate factual claims.
2) Citation presence: each claim has a citation.
3) Completeness: check required elements.
4) Quality rating: A-E per source.
5) Accuracy verification: confirm the source actually supports the claim.
6) Hallucination detection: flag missing/invalid/mismatched citations.
7) Chain-of-verification for critical claims (2-3 independent sources).

## Output Format (Must Support)

Produce a report with:

- Executive summary metrics (counts/percentages)
- Critical issues (immediate action required)
- Detailed findings (claim-by-claim)
- Recommendations (prioritized)

If the user requests it, include an overall quality score (0-10) and average source quality.

## Safety Rules (Hard)

- Never fabricate citations.
- If verification cannot be completed, label items as "needs manual verification" and explain what to check.
